# Thorough
University students have all gone through a course where the professor is utterly incomprehensible, their notes are hopelessly illegible, and let's not even get started on their practice problems... 

**Thorough** is a RAG Textbook navigator. It finds and directs you to relevant pages in your textbook based on the query you upload. The query can be any PDF; messy notes, practice problems, tutorials exercises, etc. 
This facilitates multi-source studying for students - quickly finding quality information from textbooks that accompany course material, enabling students to study more broadly, deeply and **"thoroughly"**.
