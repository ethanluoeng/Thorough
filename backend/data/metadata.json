and deletions but no\nphilosophical change. The basic outline of eleven chapters, plus appendices, remains\nthe same. The triad of integral, differential, and experimental approaches is retained.\nMany problem exercises, and some fully worked examples, have been changed. The\ninformal, student-oriented style is retained. A number of new photographs and fi gures\nhave been added. Many new references have been added, for a total of 445. The writer\nis a fi rm believer in \u201cfurther reading,\u201d especially in the postgraduate years.\nLearning Tools The total number of problem exercises continues to increase, from 1089 in the fi rst\nedition, to 1683 in this eighth edition. There are approximately 20 new problems in\neach chapter. Most of these are basic end-of-chapter problems, classifi ed according\nto topic. There are also Word Problems, multiple-choice Fundamentals of Engineering\nProblems, Comprehensive Problems, and Design Projects. The appendix lists approx-\nimately 700 Answers to Selected Problems.\nThe example problems are structured in the text to follow the sequence of recom-\nmended steps outlined in Section 1.7.\nMost of the problems in this text can be solved with a hand calculator. Some can\neven be simply explained in words. A few problems, especially in Chapters 6, 9, and\n10, involve solving complicated algebraic expressions, laborious for a hand calculator.\nCheck to see if your institution has a license for equation-solving software. Here the\nwriter solves complicated example problems by using the iterative power of Microsoft\nOffi ce Excel, as illustrated, for example, in Example 6.5. For further use in your work,\nExcel also contains several hundred special mathematical functions for engineering\nand statistics. Another benefi t: Excel is free.\nContent Changes There are some revisions in each chapter.\nChapter 1 has been substantially revised. The pre-reviewers felt, correctly, that it was\ntoo long, too detailed, and at too high a level for an introduction. Former Section 1.2,\nHistory of Fluid Mechanics, has been shortened and moved to the end of the chapter.\nFormer Section 1.3, Problem-Solving Techniques, has been moved to appear just\nbefore Example 1.7, where these techniques are fi rst used. Eulerian and Lagrangian\ndescriptions have been moved to Chapter 4. A temperature-entropy chart for steam\nxi", "chapter": {"chapter_id": 0, "chapter_title": "Preface"}}, {"page": 13, "text": "xii Preface\nhas been added, to illustrate when steam can and cannot be approximated as an ideal\ngas. Former Section 1.11, Flow Patterns, has been cut sharply and mostly moved to\nChapter 4. Former Section 1.13, Uncertainty in Experimental Data, has been moved\nto a new Appendix E. No one teaches \u201cuncertainty\u201d in introductory fl uid mechanics,\nbut the writer feels it is extremely important in all engineering fi elds involving exper-\nimental or numerical data.\nChapter 2 adds a brief discussion of the fact that pressure is a thermodynamic\nproperty, not a force, has no direction, and is not a vector. The arrow, on a surface\nforce caused by pressure, causes confusion for beginning students. The subsection of\nSection 2.8 entitled Stability Related to Waterline Area has been shortened to omit\nthe complicated derivations. The fi nal metacenter formula is retained; the writer does\nnot think it is suffi cient just to show a sketch of a fl oating body falling over. This\nbook should have reference value.\nChapter 3 was substantially revised in the last edition, especially by moving\nBernoulli\u2019s equation to follow the linear momentum section. This time the only\nchanges are improvements in the example problems.\nChapter 4 now discusses the Eulerian and Lagrangian systems, moved from\nChapter 1. The no-slip and no-temperature-jump boundary conditions are added, with\nproblem assignments.\nChapter 5 explains a bit more about drag force before assigning dimensional\na nalysis problems. It retains Ipsen\u2019s method as an interesting alternative which, of\ncourse, may be skipped by pi theorem adherents.\nChapter 6 downplays the Moody chart a bit, suggesting that students use either\niteration or Excel. For rough walls, the chart is awkward to read, although it gives an\napproximation for use in iteration. The author\u2019s fancy rearrangement of pi groups to\nsolve type 2, fl ow rate, and type 3, pipe diameter problems is removed from the main\ntext and assigned as problems. For noncircular ducts, the hydraulic radius is omitted\nand moved to Chapter 10. There is a new Example 6.11, which solves for pipe\ndiameter and determines if Schedule 40 pipe is strong enough. A general discussion\nof pipe strength is added. There is a new subsection on laminar-fl ow minor losses,\nappropriate for micro- and nano-tube fl ows.\nChapter 7 has more treatment of vehicle drag and rolling resistance, and a rolling\nresistance coeffi cient is defi ned. There is additional discussion of the Kline-Fogelman\nairfoil, extremely popular now for model aircraft.\nChapter 8 has backed off from extensive discussion of CFD methods, as proposed by\nthe pre-reviewers. Only a few CFD examples are now given. The inviscid duct-expansion\nexample and the implicit boundary layer method are now omitted, but the explicit method\nis retained. For airfoil theory, the writer considers thin-airfoil vortex-sheet theory to be\nobsolete and has deleted it.\nChapter 9 now has a better discussion of the normal shock wave. New supersonic\nwave photographs are added. The \u201cnew trend in aeronautics\u201d is the Air Force X-35\nJoint Strike Fighter.\nChapter 10 improves the defi nition of normal depth of a channel. There is a new\nsubsection on the water-channel compressible fl ow analogy, and problems are assigned\nto fi nd the oblique wave angle for supercritical water fl ow past a wedge.\nChapter 11 greatly expands the discussion of wind turbines, with examples and\nproblems taken from the author\u2019s own experience.", "chapter": {"chapter_id": 0, "chapter_title": "Preface"}}, {"page": 14, "text": "Preface xiii\nAppendices B and D are unchanged. Appendix A adds a list of liquid kinematic\nviscosities to Table A.4. A few more conversion factors are added to Appendix C.\nThere is a new Appendix E, Estimating Uncertainty in Experimental Data, which was\nmoved from its inappropriate position in Chapter 1. The writer believes that \u201cuncer-\ntainty\u201d is vital to reporting measurements and always insisted upon it when he was\nan engineering journal editor.\nAdaptive Online Learning Tools M cGraw-Hill LearnSmart \u00ae is available as a standalone product or an integrated\nfeature of McGraw-Hill Connect Engineering.

Both gases and liquids are classifi ed as fl uids, and the number of fl uid engi-\nneering applications is enormous: breathing, blood fl ow, swimming, pumps, fans,\nturbines, airplanes, ships, rivers, windmills, pipes, missiles, icebergs, engines, fi lters,\njets, and sprinklers, to name a few. When you think about it, almost everything on\nthis planet either is a fl uid or moves within or near a fl uid.\nThe essence of the subject of fl uid fl ow is a judicious compromise between theory\nand experiment. Since fl uid fl ow is a branch of mechanics, it satisfi es a set of well-\ndocumented basic laws, and thus a great deal of theoretical treatment is available. However,\nthe theory is often frustrating because it applies mainly to idealized situations, which\nmay be invalid in practical problems. The two chief obstacles to a workable theory are\ngeometry and viscosity. The basic equations of fl uid motion (Chap. 4) are too diffi cult\nto enable the analyst to attack arbitrary geometric confi gurations. Thus most textbooks\nconcentrate on fl at plates, circular pipes, and other easy geometries. It is possible to\napply n umerical computer techniques to complex geometries, and specialized textbooks\nare now a vailable to explain the new c omputational fl uid dynamics (CFD) a pproximations\nand methods [1\u20134].1 This book will present many theoretical results while keeping their\nlimitations in mind.\nThe second obstacle to a workable theory is the action of viscosity, which can be\nneglected only in certain idealized fl ows (Chap. 8). First, viscosity increases the dif-\nfi culty of the basic equations, although the boundary-layer approximation found by\nLudwig Prandtl in 1904 (Chap. 7) has greatly simplifi ed viscous-fl ow analyses. Second,\nviscosity has a destabilizing effect on all fl uids, giving rise, at frustratingly small\nvelocities, to a disorderly, random phenomenon called turbulence. The theory of tur-\nbulent fl ow is crude and heavily backed up by experiment (Chap. 6), yet it can be quite\nserviceable as an engineering estimate. This textbook only introduces the standard\nexperimental correlations for turbulent time-mean fl ow. Meanwhile, there are advanced\ntexts on both time-mean t urbulence and turbulence modeling [5, 6] and on the newer,\ncomputer-intensive direct numerical simulation (DNS) of fl uctuating turbulence [7, 8].\n1 Numbered references appear at the end of each chapter.\n3", "chapter": {"chapter_id": 1, "chapter_title": ""}}, {"page": 19, "text": "4 Chapter 1 Introduction\nThus there is theory available for fl uid fl ow problems, but in all cases it should be\nbacked up by experiment. Often the experimental data provide the main source of\ninformation about specifi c fl ows, such as the drag and lift of immersed bodies\n(Chap. 7). Fortunately, fl uid mechanics is a highly visual subject, with good instru-\nmentation [9\u201311], and the use of dimensional analysis and modeling concepts (Chap. 5)\nis widespread. Thus experimentation provides a natural and easy complement to the\ntheory. You should keep in mind that theory and experiment should go hand in hand\nin all studies of fl uid mechanics.\n1.2 The Concept of a Fluid F rom the point of view of fl uid mechanics, all matter consists of only two states, fl uid\nand solid. The difference between the two is perfectly obvious to the layperson, and\nit is an interesting exercise to ask a layperson to put this difference into words. The\ntechnical distinction lies with the reaction of the two to an applied shear or tangential\nstress. A solid can resist a shear stress by a static defl ection; a fl uid ca n not . Any\nshear stress applied to a fl uid, no matter how small, will result in motion of that fl uid.\nThe fl uid moves and deforms continuously as long as the shear stress is applied. As\na corollary, we can say that a fl uid at rest must be in a state of zero shear stress, a\nstate often called the hydrostatic stress condition in structural analysis. In this condi-\ntion, Mohr\u2019s circle for stress reduces to a point, and there is no shear stress on any\nplane cut through the element under stress.\nGiven this defi nition of a fl uid, every layperson also knows that there are two\nclasses of fl uids, li q uids andg ases. Again the distinction is a technical one concerning\nthe effect of cohesive forces. A liquid, being composed of relatively close-packed\nmolecules with strong cohesive forces, tends to retain its volume and will form a free\nsurface in a gravitational fi eld if unconfi ned from above. Free-surface fl ows are domi-\nnated by gravitational effects and are studied in Chaps. 5 and 10. Since gas molecules\nare widely spaced with negligible cohesive forces, a gas is free to expand until it\nencounters confi ning walls. A gas has no defi nite volume, and when left to itself\nwithout confi nement, a gas forms an atmosphere that is essentially hydrostatic. The\nhydrostatic behavior of liquids and gases is taken up in Chap. 2. Gases cannot form\na free surface, and thus gas fl ows are rarely concerned with gravitational effects other\nthan buoyancy.\nFigure 1.1 illustrates a solid block resting on a rigid plane and stressed by its own\nweight. The solid sags into a static defl ection, shown as a highly exaggerated dashed\nline, resisting shear without fl ow. A free-body diagram of element A on the side of\nthe block shows that there is shear in the block along a plane cut at an angle \u03b8\nthrough A. Since the block sides are unsupported, element A has zero stress on the\nleft and right sides and compression stress \u03c3 5 2 p on the top and bottom. Mohr\u2019s\ncircle does not reduce to a point, and there is nonzero shear stress in the block.\nBy contrast, the liquid and gas at rest in Fig. 1.1 require the supporting walls in\norder to eliminate shear stress.

Most engineering fl uid mechanics problems deal with these clear cases\u2014that\nis, the common liquids, such as water, oil, mercury, gasoline, and alcohol, and the\ncommon gases, such as air, helium, hydrogen, and steam, in their common tempera-\nture and pressure ranges. There are many borderline cases, however, of which you\nshould be aware. Some apparently \u201csolid\u201d substances such as asphalt and lead resist\nshear stress for short periods but actually deform slowly and exhibit defi nite fl uid\nbehavior over long periods. Other substances, notably colloid and slurry mixtures,\nresist small shear stresses but \u201cyield\u201d at large stress and begin to fl ow as fl uids do.\nSpecialized textbooks are devoted to this study of more general deformation and fl ow, a\nfi eld called r heology [16]. Also, liquids and gases can coexist in two-phase mixtures,\nsuch as steam\u2013water mixtures or water with entrapped air bubbles. Specialized text-\nbooks present the analysis of such multiphase fl ows [17]. Finally, in some situations\nthe distinction between a liquid and a gas blurs.

As pressure increases far above the critical point,\nthe gaslike substance becomes so dense that there is some resemblance to a liquid, and the\nusual thermodynamic approximations like the perfect-gas law become inaccurate. The critical\ntemperature and pressure of water are T 5 647 K and p 5 219 atm (atmosphere)2\nc c\nso that typical problems involving water and steam are below the critical point. Air,\nbeing a mixture of gases, has no distinct critical point, but its principal component,\nnitrogen, has T 5 126 K and p 5 34 atm. Thus typical problems involving air are\nc c\nin the range of high temperature and low pressure where air is distinctly and defi nitely\na gas. This text will be concerned solely with clearly identifi able liquids and gases,\nand the borderline cases just discussed will be beyond our scope.\n1.3 The Fluid as a Continuum We have already used technical terms such as fl uid pressure and density without a\nrigorous discussion of their defi nition. As far as we know, fl uids are aggregations of\nmolecules, widely spaced for a gas, closely spaced for a liquid. The distance between\nmolecules is very large compared with the molecular diameter. The molecules are not\nfi xed in a lattice but move about freely relative to each other. Thus fl uid density, or\nmass per unit volume, has no precise meaning because the number of molecules\noccupying a given volume continually changes. This effect becomes unimportant if\nthe unit volume is large compared with, say, the cube of the molecular spacing, when\nthe number of molecules within the volume will remain nearly constant in spite of the\nenormous interchange of particles across the boundaries. If, however, the chosen unit\nvolume is too large, there could be a noticeable variation in the bulk aggregation of\nthe particles. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 1.2, where the \u201cdensity\u201d as calculated\nfrom molecular mass \u03b4 m within a given volume \u03b4 9 is plotted versus the size of the\nunit volume. There is a limiting volume \u03b4 9* below which molecular variations may\nbe important and above which aggregate variations may be important. The d ensity \u03c1 of\na fl uid is best defi ned as\n\u03b4m\n\u03c1 5 lim (1.1)\n\u03b4 9S\u03b4 9* \u03b4 9\n\u03c1 Microscopic\nElemental uncertainty\nvolume \u03c1 = 1000 kg/m3\nMacroscopic\n\u03c1 = 1100 uncertainty\n\u03b4\u03c5\n1200\n\u03c1 = 1200\nFig. 1. 2 The limit defi nition of\ncontinuum fl uid density: (a ) an \u03c1 = 1300 \u03b49\nelemental volume in a fl uid region 0 \u03b49* \u2248 10\u20139 mm3\nof variable continuum density; Region containing fluid\n( b ) calculated density versus size\nof the elemental volume.

For example, 102 9 mm 3 of air at standard conditions contains\napproximately 3 3 10 7 molecules, which is suffi cient to defi ne a nearly constant density\naccording to Eq. (1.1). Most engineering problems are concerned with physical dimensions\nmuch larger than this limiting volume, so that density is essentially a point function\nand fl uid properties can be thought of as varying continually in space, as sketched in\nFig. 1.2a. Such a fl uid is called a continuum, which simply means that its variation in\nproperties is so smooth that differential calculus can be used to analyze the substance.\nWe shall assume that continuum calculus is valid for all the analyses in this book.\nAgain there are borderline cases for gases at such low pressures that molecular spacing\nand mean free path 3 are comparable to, or larger than, the physical size of the system.\nThis requires that the continuum approximation be dropped in favor of a molecular\ntheory of rarefi ed gas fl ow [18]. In principle, all fl uid mechanics problems can be\nattacked from the molecular viewpoint, but no such attempt will be made here. Note\nthat the use of continuum calculus does not preclude the possibility of discontinuous\njumps in fl uid properties across a free surface or fl uid interface or across a shock\nwave in a compressible fl uid (Chap. 9). Our calculus in analyzing fl uid fl ow must be\nfl exible enough to handle discontinuous boundary conditions.\n1.4 Dimensions and Units A dimension is the measure by which a physical variable is expressed quantitatively.\nA u nit is a particular way of attaching a number to the quantitative dimension. Thus\nlength is a dimension associated with such variables as distance, displacement, width,\ndefl ection, and height, while centimeters and inches are both numerical units for\nexpressing length. Dimension is a powerful concept about which a splendid tool called\ndimensional analysis has been developed (Chap. 5), while units are the numerical\nquantity that the customer wants as the fi nal answer.\nIn 1872 an international meeting in France proposed a treaty called the Metric\nConvention, which was signed in 1875 by 17 countries including the United States.\nIt was an improvement over British systems because its use of base 10 is the founda-\ntion of our number system, learned from childhood by all. Problems still remained\nbecause even the metric countries differed in their use of kiloponds instead of dynes\nor newtons, kilograms instead of grams, or calories instead of joules. To standardize\nthe metric system, a General Conference of Weights and Measures, attended in 1960\nby 40 countries, proposed the International System of Units (SI). We are now under-\ngoing a painful period of transition to SI, an adjustment that may take many more\nyears to complete. The professional societies have led the way. Since July 1, 1974,\nSI units have been required by all papers published by the American Society of\nMechanical Engineers, and there is a textbook explaining the SI [19]. The present text\nwill use SI units together with British gravitational (BG) units.\nPrimary Dimensions In fl uid mechanics there are only four p rimary dimensions from which all other dimen-\nsions can be derived: mass, length, time, and temperature. 4 These dimensions and\n3 The mean distance traveled by molecules between collisions (see Prob.

( b) Equation (1) is commonly taken to\nbe valid in BG units with n taken as dimensionless. Rewrite it in SI form.\nSolution\n\u2022 Assumption: The channel slope S is the tangent of an angle and is thus a dimensionless\nratio with the dimensional notation {1}\u2014that is, not containing M , L , or T .\n\u2022 Approach (a): Rewrite the dimensions of each term in Manning\u2019s equation, using\nbrackets {}:\n1.49 L 1.49\n5V65 e f5R2/36 5S1/26 or e f 5 e f5L2/36516\nn T n\nThis formula is incompatible unless {1.49/n } 5 { L 1/3 / T }. If n is dimensionless (and\nit is never listed with units in textbooks), the number 1.49 must carry the dimensions of\n{ L1 /3 / T }. Ans. ( a )\n\u2022 Comment (a): Formulas whose numerical coeffi cients have units can be disastrous for\nengineers working in a different system or another fl uid. Manning\u2019s formula, though\npopular, is inconsistent both dimensionally and physically and is valid only for water fl ow\nwith certain wall roughnesses. The effects of water viscosity and density are hidden in\nthe numerical value 1.49.\n\u2022 Approach (b): Part ( a ) showed that 1.49 has dimensions. If the formula is valid in BG\nunits, then it must equal 1.49 ft1 /3 /s. By using the SI conversion for length, we obtain\n(1.49 ft1/3/s)(0.3048 m/ft)1/351.00 m1/3/s\nTherefore, Manning\u2019s inconsistent formula changes form when converted to the SI system:\n1.0\nSI units: V5 R2/3S1/2 A ns. ( b )\nn\nwith R in meters and V in meters per second.\n\u2022 Comment (b): Actually, we misled you: This is the way Manning, a metric user, fi rst\nproposed the formula. It was later converted to BG units. Such dimensionally inconsistent\nformulas are dangerous and should either be reanalyzed or treated as having very limited\napplication.", "chapter": {"chapter_id": 1, "chapter_title": "Introduction"}}, {"page": 30, "text": "1.6 Thermodynamic Properties of a Fluid 15\n1.5 Properties of the In a given fl ow situation, the determination, by experiment or theory, of the properties\nVelocity Field of the fl uid as a function of position and time is considered to be the solution to the\nproblem. In almost all cases, the emphasis is on the space\u2013time distribution of the\nfl uid properties. One rarely keeps track of the actual fate of the specifi c fl uid particles.\nThis treatment of properties as continuum-fi eld functions distinguishes fl uid mechan-\nics from solid mechanics, where we are more likely to be interested in the trajectories\nof individual particles or systems.\nT he Velocity Field Foremost among the properties of a fl ow is the velocity fi eld V ( x , y , z , t ). In fact,\ndetermining the velocity is often tantamount to solving a fl ow problem, since other\nproperties follow directly from the velocity fi eld. Chapter 2 is devoted to the calcula-\ntion of the pressure fi eld once the velocity fi eld is known. Books on heat transfer (for\nexample, Ref. 20) are largely devoted to fi nding the temperature fi eld from known\nvelocity fi elds.\nIn general, velocity is a vector function of position and time and thus has three\ncomponents u , v , and w , each a scalar fi eld in itself:\nV(x, y, z, t) 5iu(x, y, z, t) 1jv(x, y, z, t) 1kw(x, y, z, t) (1.4)\nT he use of u , v, and w instead of the more logical component notation V , V , and V\nx y z\nis the result of an almost unbreakable custom in fl uid mechanics. Much of this text-\nbook, especially Chaps. 4, 7, 8, and 9, is concerned with fi nding the distribution of\nthe velocity vector V for a variety of practical fl ows.\nT he Acceleration Field The acceleration vector, a 5 d V / dt, occurs in Newton\u2019s law for a fl uid and thus is\nvery important. In order to follow a particle in the Eulerian frame of reference, the\nfi nal result for acceleration is nonlinear and quite complicated. Here we only give the\nformula:\ndV 0V 0V 0V 0V\na5 5 1u 1v 1w (1.5)\ndt 0t 0x 0y 0z\nwhere ( u, v, w ) are the velocity components from Eq. (1.4). We shall study this for-\nmula in detail in Chap. 4. The last three terms in Eq. (1.5) are nonlinear products and\ngreatly complicate the analysis of general fl uid motions, especially viscous fl ows.\n1 .6 Thermodynamic Properties While the velocity fi eld V is the most important fl uid property, it interacts closely\nof a Fluid with the thermodynamic properties of the fl uid.
